 <!-- The meta type, product and factory are used to instantiate the object 
      in Plone's UI. The name of the object in portal_types (i.e. the object 
      we are configuring in this file) is referred to as the "portal_type". 
      Normally, the meta_type and portal_type are the same, but not always. 
      The meta_type can generally not be changed, whilst the portal_type is
      configurable in the ZODB, by renaming the FTI object in portal_types.
      
      Here, we set the name of the product (this package) and a factory 
      method, which is actually generated for us by Archetypes, based on the
      type name.
      
      CMF also supports register a named utility providing the interface
      zope.component.interfaces.IFactory, which will be called to create the 
      content object, in which case this is named in the 'factory' parameter
      and the 'product' parameter must be left blank. However, this does not
      play well with some of Archetypes' assumptions about acquisition 
      contexts, so we use the traditional approach instead.

 <!-- The immediate_view is supposed to be the view that is shown immediately
      after an object is created. Plone currently doesn't use this, however.
      It will always show the "edit" form during content creation, and then
      go to the view.

 <!-- global_allow specifies whether the object is generally addable. If
      this is False, only those folders that set filter_content_types to
      True and includes the portal_type of this object in the list of
      allowed_content_types will allow creation of this type. Here,
      we let cinema folders be addable in normal folders (provided the
      user has the appropriate permissions, of course). We then explicitly
      filter the content types allowed inside a Cinema Folder, restricting
      them to Cinema, Promotion and other nested Cinema Folders. Of course, 
      this can be changed in the ZODB later.

 <!-- Finally, we define method aliases and actions. For most content
      types, these are the same. The (Default) alias can reference a
      view or page template name, but by using a "dynamic views" FTI, we
      use the "(dynamic view)" pseudo-target to mean "the current selection".
      The names 'edit', 'sharing' and 'view' are conventions in Plone.
      
      Notice how the actions (which are rendered as tabs) use standard
      URLs which reference the method aliases. You can of course add new
      method aliases and/or new actions (tabs) if necessary.
